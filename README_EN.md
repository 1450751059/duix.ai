## Introduction

DUIX, short for ‚ÄúDialogue User Interface System‚Äù, is a digital human intelligent interaction platform created by Silicon Intelligence. The digital human SDK has been open-sourced, allowing developers to deploy on Android and iOS devices with one click, providing users with immediate virtual human interaction experience. The built-in two avatars allow users to easily get started and directly experience the charm of digital humans.

The SDK not only provides intuitive effect demonstration but also supports users for secondary development. Developers can easily develop customized virtual human applications based on the provided open documentation. The Silicon-based Digital Human SDK is completely open-source, with both the underlying inference engine and the upper-level commercial application logic open to source code. Developers can delve into its working principle and further optimize and innovate.<br><br>
